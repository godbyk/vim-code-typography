vim-code-typography
===================

This collection of vim scripts uses the new conceal feature (available in vim
7.3 and above) to replace some strings with more typographically pleasing
versions.

For example, the following C++ file:

    #include <iostream>
    #include <cmath>

    int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
        std::cout << "I will calculate the length of a hypotenuse given the lengths" << std::endl;
        std::cout << "of the other two legs of the triangle." << std::endl;

        double a = 0.0;
        std::cout << "Enter the length of the first leg: ";
        std::cin >> a;

        double b = 0.0;
        std::cout << "And the length of the second leg: ";
        std::cin >> b;

        double c = std::sqrt(a * a + b * b);
        std::cout << "The length of the hypotenuse is " << c << std::endl;
        return 0;
    }

appears like this in vim:

    #include <iostream>
    #include <cmath>

    int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
        std∷cout « "I will calculate the length of a hypotenuse given the lengths" « std∷endl;
        std∷cout « "of the other two legs of the triangle." « std∷endl;

        double a ← 0.0;
        std∷cout « "Enter the length of the first leg: ";
        std∷cin » a;

        double b ← 0.0;
        std∷cout « "And the length of the second leg: ";
        std∷cin » b;

        double c ← √(a×a + b×b);
        std∷cout « "The length of the hypotenuse is " « c « std∷endl;
        return 0;
    }

History
-------

This code was based on the vim-cute-python plugin (available at
<https://github.com/ehamberg/vim-cute-python>).

Future work
-----------

This is only a first draft (and I've never messed with vim's syntax
highlighting before, so I'm sure there are better ways to go about this), so if
you have any comments, suggestions, criticisms, etc., feel free to let me know.

I'd also like to extend this to a variety of other languages.
